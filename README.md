Twenty Squares
===
Better known as the Royal Game of Ur

This game is played on a single PICO-8 controller.

Rules
---
Your aim is to bear off all of your pieces from the end of the board before your opponent.

At the start of your turn, 4 dice are rolled which are equally likely to land on 0 or 1. The sum of these dice is your roll for the turn.

After you roll, choose one of your pieces to move around the board the amount shown. You can't move to a square occupied by one of your own pieces, or to a rosette occupied by any piece. 

If you land on a piece belonging to your opponent, you capture it. The piece is removed from the board and returned to your opponent.

If you land on a rosette, you take an extra turn. (Additionally, pieces on rosettes cannot be captured, as described above.)

To bear off one of your pieces, it must move the exact number of spaces necessary to move past the end of the board; *i.e.* if one of your pieces is on the very last square of the board, you must roll a 1 (and no other number) to bear it off.

Strategy
---
The most commonly rolled number is 2 (37.5%), followed by 1 and 3 (25% each), then 0 and 4 (6.25% each).

The middle column of the board is the only place where pieces can be captured. It is often a good idea to keep pieces in a position where they can capture any of the opponent's pieces that try to enter this column, but bear in mind that making such a capture will often leave your own pieces vulnerable.

Conversely, the lone rosette in the middle column is an important square to control, because it is the only square on that column where pieces can't be captured.

It is often a good idea to bear off pieces near the end of the board as soon as possible, so that there is room for more pieces to advance.

This game requires some amount luck, so it's possible (though unlikely) for a novice to win against a master. If you're experiencing a streak of bad luck, don't worry! One of the compelling things about Twenty Squares is that it's always possible to make a surprise comeback.
